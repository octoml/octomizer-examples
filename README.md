# octomizer-examples

A public repository of helpful scripts, models, and useful resources for users of the Octomizer.

Currently, this repository includes a small number of previously converted ONNX models for trial use with the Octomizer.

If you are unfamiliar with ONNX format models, we recommend using the ONNX tutorials to convert your model from TensorFlow, PyTorch, or other common model formats.

The Octomizer uses ONNX-RT, the runtime for the ONNX model format, as a second inferencing engine and common comparison point with TVM.  While we will attempt to support as many models as possible in ONNX-RT, not all models will run in ONNX-RT.
